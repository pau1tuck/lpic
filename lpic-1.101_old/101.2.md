## Topic 102: Booting the System

### Concepts

#### BIOS

The **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** is a firmware that provides the basic instructions for how the computer starts up and interacts with its hardware components.

The BIOS performs a power-on self-test (POST) when the computer is first turned on, checks the system configuration, and loads the bootloader, which then loads the operating system.

The BIOS also provides a user-configurable interface for setting system configuration options, such as the boot order of storage devices.

The BIOS is located on a non-volatile memory chip on the motherboard, and its functionality has been largely replaced by the **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** in recent years.

### Bootloaders

#### LILO

**LILO (LInux LOader)** was a boot loader for Linux operating systems, used to _load the Linux kernel into memory and start the operating system_. LILO was popular in the early days of Linux, but has since been largely replaced by GRUB as the default boot loader for most Linux distributions. LILO's main advantage was its ability to boot other operating systems, such as MS-DOS, in addition to Linux.

#### SYSLINUX

**SYSLINUX** is a boot loader for the Linux operating system that boots from a FAT file system, such as a floppy disk, flash drive or a network server. It is commonly used for booting live Linux distributions and for creating bootable rescue disks.

#### GRUB

**GRUB (The GRand Unified Bootloader)** is a bootloader package that provides the means to boot multiple operating systems. It is widely used as the default bootloader for most Linux distributions, as it allows users to choose between multiple operating systems installed on their computer and provides advanced boot options, such as recovery mode or booting into a specific kernel version.
