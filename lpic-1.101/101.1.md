## Topic 101: Systems Architecture

### 101.1 Determine and configure hardware settings

_Candidates should be able to determine and configure fundamental system hardware._

#### Key Knowledge Areas:

* Enable and disable integrated peripherals.
* Differentiate between the various types of mass storage devices.
* Determine hardware resources for devices.
* Tools and utilities to list various hardware information (e.g. lsusb, lspci, etc.).
* Tools and utilities to manipulate USB devices.
* Conceptual understanding of sysfs, (HAL), udev and dbus.
* The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:
  * /sys/
  * /proc/
    * /proc/sys
  * /dev/
  * lspci
  * lsusb
  * lsmod
  * modprobe
    * /etc/modprobe.d
  * rmmod
  * uuid

#### udev

udev is a device manager for the Linux kernel. It dynamically creates and manages device nodes in the /dev directory based on events generated by the kernel, such as the addition or removal of a device.

#### sysfs (/sys)

sysfs is a virtual file system in the Linux kernel that exports information about various kernel objects, including devices, to user space. It provides a standard way for users to access information about the system and its components, such as device attributes, configuration settings, and status information.

sysfs is used by many system components, including udev, to retrieve information about devices and make decisions about how to manage them. When a new device is detected by the kernel, information about it is exported to sysfs, where udev can then access and use it to create device nodes and manage the device.

#### /proc File System

(/etc/sysctrl.conf)
The /proc file system is a virtual file system in Linux that provides information about the system and its processes.

It is a dynamically-created file system, meaning that its contents are generated in real-time by the kernel and are not stored on a physical disk.

#### dbus

D-Bus is a message-passing system used in Linux-based operating systems. It provides a way for different applications and system components to communicate with each other, allowing them to send and receive messages and exchange information.

D-Bus simplifies inter-process communication, making it easier for applications to work together and share information. It provides a common interface for communication, which makes it easier for developers to write applications that can work seamlessly with other software on the system.
